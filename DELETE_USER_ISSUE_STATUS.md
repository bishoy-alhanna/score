# Delete User Issue - Quick Resolution Status

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED: JWT Verification Mismatch

The problem is that the JWT token created by the auth service login endpoint is being rejected by the API gateway's JWT verification for subsequent requests.

### Evidence:
1. Login works: `POST /api/super-admin/login` returns valid token
2. Token rejected: Same token fails for `GET /api/super-admin/users` 
3. Error message: "Super admin authentication required"
4. Frontend error: "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" (trying to parse non-JSON 401 response)

### Root Cause:
- JWT verification logic differs between auth service and API gateway
- API gateway `verify_jwt_token()` function may have different validation logic
- Both services use same secret key but verification implementation differs

### Quick Fix Required:
1. **Synchronize JWT verification** between auth service and API gateway
2. **Update frontend error handling** to handle non-JSON 401 responses
3. **Test with fresh token** to verify fix

### Status: ðŸ”§ IDENTIFIED - Ready to fix JWT verification logic

The delete functionality is properly implemented in backend and frontend, but JWT authentication is blocking all super-admin requests through API gateway.
