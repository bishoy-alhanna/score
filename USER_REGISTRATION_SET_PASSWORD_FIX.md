# User Registration Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary
User dashboard registration was failing with the error: `"'User' object has no attribute 'set_password'"`

## Root Cause
The User model in `/backend/auth-service/src/models/database_multi_org.py` was missing the `set_password()` method that was being called during user registration.

## Solution Implemented
Added the missing `set_password()` method to the User model:

```python
def set_password(self, password):
    """Set user password using bcrypt hashing"""
    self.password_hash = self.hash_password(password)
```

## Location of Fix
**File**: `/backend/auth-service/src/models/database_multi_org.py`
**Lines**: Added around line 210, between `verify_password()` and `hash_password()` methods

## Test Results ✅
User registration now works correctly:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"uniqueuser789","email":"unique789@example.com","password":"testpass123","first_name":"Unique","last_name":"User"}' \
  http://localhost/api/auth/register
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": "f5a1fc55-d0f5-4c98-bd75-b79770ed16a8",
    "username": "uniqueuser789",
    "email": "unique789@example.com",
    "first_name": "Unique",
    "last_name": "User",
    "is_active": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Related Methods
The User model now has complete password functionality:
- ✅ `set_password(password)` - Sets user password with bcrypt hashing
- ✅ `verify_password(password)` - Verifies password against stored hash  
- ✅ `hash_password(password)` - Static method for password hashing

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
User registration from the user dashboard should now work without any "set_password" attribute errors.

## Services Updated
- ✅ Auth Service rebuilt and deployed
- ✅ User registration endpoint functional
- ✅ Password hashing working correctly
