# Delete User Feature Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive delete user functionality across both Organization Admin and Super Admin interfaces of the Score platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Organization Admin - User Removal
**Location**: `App.jsx` - UsersManagement component
**Functionality**: 
- Remove users from the current organization (organization-scoped deletion)
- Confirmation dialog with clear warning about action
- API endpoint: `DELETE /api/auth/organizations/{organization_id}/users/{user_id}`

**User Interface**:
- Red "Remove" button in user management table
- Modal confirmation dialog explaining the action
- Clear messaging that user will be removed from the organization

### 2. Super Admin - User Deletion
**Location**: `SuperAdminDashboard.jsx`
**Functionality**:
- Platform-wide user deletion with soft delete implementation
- Deactivates user and removes from all organizations
- API endpoint: `DELETE /api/super-admin/users/{user_id}`

**User Interface**:
- Red "Delete" button in All Users tab
- Comprehensive confirmation modal with action details
- Clear warning that action is irreversible

### 3. Backend API Endpoints Added

#### Organization Admin Endpoint
```python
@auth_bp.route('/organizations/<int:organization_id>/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def remove_user_from_organization(organization_id, user_id):
    # Removes user from specific organization
    # Soft delete pattern - removes UserOrganization relationship
```

#### Super Admin Endpoint
```python
@super_admin_bp.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_user(user_id):
    # Platform-wide user deletion
    # Sets is_active=False and removes from all organizations
```

### 4. Complete User Management Feature Set

#### Organization Admin Interface (App.jsx)
✅ **Invite User**: Add new users to organization
✅ **Edit User**: Modify user information (username, email, names)
✅ **Reset Password**: Set new passwords for users
✅ **Change Role**: Toggle between User and Org Admin roles
✅ **Enable/Disable**: Toggle user active status
✅ **Remove User**: Remove user from organization (NEW)

#### Super Admin Interface (SuperAdminDashboard.jsx)
✅ **View All Users**: See all platform users with organization memberships
✅ **User Details Modal**: Comprehensive user information display
✅ **Activate/Deactivate**: Platform-wide status toggle
✅ **Delete User**: Permanent user deletion with soft delete (NEW)

### 5. Security & Safety Features
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Both interfaces require confirmation before deletion
- **Role-Based Access**: Organization admins can only affect their org users
- **Soft Delete**: Super admin deletion deactivates rather than hard delete
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand exactly what will happen
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and loading states

### 6. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Consistent Design**: Both interfaces use similar button styling and layouts
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Delete buttons are styled as destructive actions (red)
- **Responsive Modals**: Confirmation dialogs work on all screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during async operations
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages when operations fail
